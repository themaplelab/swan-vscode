# SWAN VSCode extension
SWAN is a static program analysis framework for analyzing Swift applications using [WALA](https://github.com/wala/WALA) as the analysis core. This repository contains the VSCode extension source for SWAN, which acts as a driver and results viewer for running taint analysis on Swift applications.
